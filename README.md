# Skipper

A CLI tool for managing SSH connections with an interactive terminal UI. Skipper reads your `~/.ssh/config` file and lets you browse, search, and connect to hosts without memorizing aliases.You can fuzzy-search aliases and connection details, then connect immediately from the same screen — or skip the UI entirely when there's only one match.

## Features

- **Interactive host selection** -- filterable list of SSH hosts powered by [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
- **SSH config parsing** -- reads host aliases, users, hostnames, ports, and identity files from your SSH config
- **Fuzzy search** -- quickly narrow down hosts by typing
- **Seamless connection** -- selects a host and drops you straight into an SSH session

## Installation
### Quick Install

Easily install Skipper using the provided install script, or download a release binary for your platform.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JerryAgbesi/skipper/main/install.sh | sh
```


### Download a release binary

1. Head to the [Releases](https://github.com/JerryAgbesi/skipper/releases/latest) page
2. Download the archive for your platform (e.g. `skipper_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz`)
3. Extract and move to your PATH:

```bash
tar -xzf skipper_*_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/
```

4. Verify the installation:

skipper --version
```

### Build from source

Prerequisites:
- [Go](https://go.dev/) 1.25+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JerryAgbesi/skipper.git
cd skipper
make build
sudo mv skipper /usr/local/bin/
```

## Development

If you want to explore or contribute to the codebase:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JerryAgbesi/skipper.git
cd skipper
make run
```

Run the test suite with:

```bash
make test
```

Unit tests live alongside the Go packages they exercise under `cmd/` and `internal/`.

## Usage

```
skipper [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-a, --add <alias> <target>` | Add a host entry to the SSH config using a target like `user@host[:port]` |
| `-c, --config <path>` | Path to SSH config file (default: `~/.ssh/config`) |
| `-f, --find [term]` | Open directly in find mode, or pre-filter hosts when a search term is provided |
| `-v, --version` | Print version |
| `-h, --help` | Show help |
