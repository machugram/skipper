# Skipper

A CLI tool for managing SSH connections with an interactive terminal UI. Skipper reads your `~/.ssh/config` file and lets you browse, search, and connect to hosts without memorizing aliases.You can fuzzy-search aliases and connection details, then connect immediately from the same screen — or skip the UI entirely when there's only one match.

## Features

- **Interactive host selection** -- filterable list of SSH hosts powered by [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
- **SSH config parsing** -- reads host aliases, users, hostnames, ports, and identity files from your SSH config
- **Fuzzy search** -- quickly narrow down hosts by typing
- **Seamless connection** -- selects a host and drops you straight into an SSH session
