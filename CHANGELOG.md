## [v0.2.1]

### Added

- `skipper add` subcommand for writing a new host
  entry to the SSH config. It opens up a form to add the entries for new hosts

## [v0.2.0]

### Added

- `skipper add <alias> <user@host[:port]>` subcommand for writing a new host
  entry to the SSH config. Inherits the `-c, --config` persistent flag.
- Idempotent re-runs of `skipper add` with the same alias and target now
  report `host "<alias>" already exists ..., no change` instead of claiming
  the entry was added.

### Removed

- **BREAKING**: the `-a, --add` flag on the root command has been removed.
  Migrate to the `add` subcommand:

  ```bash
  # before
  skipper --add devone user@10.0.0.8:9000

  # after
  skipper add devone user@10.0.0.8:9000
  ```
